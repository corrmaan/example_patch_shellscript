# rattlesnakeos-scripts
My scripts for Rattlesnake OS, forked from dan-v's repo with added OpenGApps.

Remember to add the following to your `~/.rattlesnakeos.toml` config file:

````toml
[[custom-scripts]]
  repo = "https://github.com/corrmaan/rattlesnakeos-scripts"
  scripts = [ "00001-opengapps-dependencies.sh", ]
````
